# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect Grouping and Sorting
This repository demonstrates a bug in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline that leads to incorrect grouping and sorting of data. The bug is caused by an error in the `$group` stage of the pipeline, which results in unexpected results. The solution shows how to correct this error.

## Bug Description
The original aggregation pipeline groups the data incorrectly, leading to inaccurate counts and sorting.  The `$group` stage is not correctly specifying the grouping key, resulting in incorrect aggregation.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates how to correct the aggregation pipeline by properly defining the `$group` stage to correctly group the data.  This results in the correct counts and sorting.
